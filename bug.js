This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with certain Android devices.  The camera preview freezes or displays a black screen after a short period of time. This isn't consistent across all devices, making debugging difficult. The error is not consistently logged in the console, making identification challenging.  It seems related to memory management or resource contention, but the exact cause remains elusive. 

Example Code (bug.js):
```javascript
import * as Camera from 'expo-camera';
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [hasPermission, setHasPermission] = useState(null);
  const [type, setType] = useState(Camera.Constants.Type.back);
  const cameraRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
      setHasPermission(status === 'granted');
    })();
  }, []);

  if (hasPermission === null) {
    return <View />;}
  if (hasPermission === false) {
    return <Text>No access to camera</Text>;
  }
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} type={type} ref={cameraRef}>
      </Camera>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
