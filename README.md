# Expo Camera Preview Freeze on Android

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API on certain Android devices. The camera preview intermittently freezes or displays a black screen. The issue is inconsistent and lacks clear error messages in the console, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description
The camera preview freezes after a variable amount of time. The problem appears to be related to memory management or resource contention but the exact cause is unknown.  No specific error messages provide clues in the console log.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application on a physical Android device (certain devices are more prone to the issue).
3. Observe the camera preview.  After some time, the preview may freeze or turn black.

## Solution
The solution involves adding error handling and investigating memory usage.  A possible solution is implemented in `bugSolution.js` but may need further optimization depending on your specific use-case and device.
